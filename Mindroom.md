# The Mindroom
The nature of dnd tends to lean on dialogue and conversation more than it does on conventional storytelling. However, that doesn't mean it's completely sceneless. A poignant aspect of the work is a setting called the "mindroom".

The mindroom, interestingly, isn't much of a "real" place either. Even before dnd, the author Daytura has exercised usage of this conceptual space as a writing device to conduct his text. It is, for the most part, fictional through and through.

In addition to being a potent focus point in dnd, it also heightens the complexity of the narrative. In the former, instability is represented by cracks growing on the walls.^[It's implied much of the conflict in his sections stems from his latent instability, which is now confirmed to stem from his own rejection of boredom.] But in the latter, it is part of an equation that blurs the [[Outside|fictionalized "outside"]] world of matter and reality, and the fictionalized "inside" world of thoughts and ideas in the mindroom.
