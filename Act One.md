# Act One
---

The first act of [[dnd]] is titled [dnd (dave and day, do not disturb (and a lack of dungeons or dragons))](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J_nMoKghGjQJj96NHDwZ8HPywZ67xvE5QXqCHZXlPFU/edit). It is an introduction to the two characters [[dave|Dave]] and [[day|Day]] and their budding relationship. It consists of 20 sections, each alternating back and forth between their points of view. Interestingly, it is a very strong entrypoint into the *dnd* and can be read by itself.
