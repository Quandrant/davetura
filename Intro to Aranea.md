## Your Eyes Have Been Closed / Intro to Aranea

*Worked from the short story assignment in my creative writing class in the Fall 2020 semester. I suggest reading the footnotes after you've finished the story, though, since they're pretty cursory and spoil a bit of the writing.*

The smart assistant’s call came through the kitchen like a series of chirps; a soothing set of four syllables matched to an equally soothing bellchime of a voice to sing, “Teatime at four!”

Aranea looked up from her isle. The electronic slab of silica, light, and glass slipped away from her vision just as the rest of the kitchen came into view. There was her long granite counter, of course, gleaming in the afternoon light streaming through the west window; then the heavyweight stove under the metal-clad ventilation unit; a compact toaster oven standing in east wait; an elegant chrome faucet atop a deep sink; a plucky set of bamboo cabinets high and low; even a handsome Chemex near the center. Noise, it seemed, always was alluring to her aural biology--but the source was nowhere to be found within this wide glance of her meal block.

Her lips pressed together, then came apart. So began the optical trail from one vertical edge of the area to the other, left to right, high to low, red cardinal^[While I'm re-editing this work, I may as well throw in some footnotes. This is a play on words! Aranea is definitely looking by the "cardinal" directions, but the inclination to bird motifs metamorph the otherwise simple description.] to green cardinal…

Where *was* her smart assistant this time?

Very well. It was about time she tested out the latest software patch on her impromptu secretary anyway. Aranea’s hands soon came to meet each other in a kind of cheerful slapping from one metacarpal from the next.^[She's...uh, clapping twice here. I really was going overboard with the roundabout descriptions. Which wouldn't be that bad because that *is* how I write, but it really only works if it's sustained throughout the work!] But this display of coarse motor skill paled in comparison to the quasi-eldritch utterance escaping deep from her gut and out through her mouth.

“Hey, get your feathers out from the fridge."

By god, the squawking. It would’ve been horrific if it weren’t coming from the small elastomer blackbird flapping up from behind the kitchen isle to greet her outstretched hand. The entire length of it’s rotund body shook a bit to put down its feathers, then rested in a position as neutral as can be. Technological development wasn’t as hectic as the century prior, but still, the very existence of such prolific digital substrata in the 22nd century truly was a boon. Especially when her local artificial intelligence had a penchant for incarnating in the form of cute, cuddly birds at this moment in time. (For most people anyway. The conspiracists were far more horrified by this recent development of “government surveillance” than they were of, say, mercurial android mass-murderers.)

Her fingers came to rest at the soft neck of the avian facsimile. The material here seemed to be much more pliable than the rest of it’s globular body. How could she stay mad at such an innocent digital animal? It was like glaring at a panda for eating bamboo. It just followed programming.

“Sorry for yelling at you,” Aranea murmured, “But you’re flighty.”

A meticulously carved beak poked into her upper palm, perhaps to say, “And you’re mopey. What’s new?”

Actually, it did say it. This was a technological bird with technological benefits, like acting as the right hand of a rad AI inhabiting the virtual framing of Aranea’s house. The voice, light and with an unexpected sting, came out through the acoustic walls in high-fidelity audio. The beak of the bird remained still. But Aranea couldn’t help but be stunned a bit by the snarky reply. Goodness, when did she last touch the block programming on this thing? It was supposed to spout reminders, not alarmingly realistic jabs. 

Unfortunately, such thoughts were inaccessible to her, for her swift tongue leapt up on the defensive. “Cut the snark or no more head scratches. Or food. You eat food, right?"

The blackbird held its peace. Suddenly it seemed like Aranea was the crazy one, as the bird assumed the role of a silent sage awaiting the next turn of events to pass. She had to admit she found the behavior quite impressive. It seemed like no one had the ability to make capricous shifts in attitude and tone these days, and of course they were the spice of social life. Then again, the device had an intense computer for a brain and a body with an intense desire to defecate, so maybe it wasn’t too much of a surprise.

“Yeah. No more trail mix or apple juice,” she continued. By now, she was rubbing the pad of her thumb over the bird’s smooth cranium. Her thumb flattened a bit as the curve came to.

“Orange juice is better,” the tiny thing piped back.

What a peculiar answer. “Do you even know what it tastes like?” she replied in a deft stride.

“Qualia is fallible. I’m just stating the dominant preference.”^[If you couldn't tell already, I pulled that claim out of my rear. I don't think subjective experience is *that* falliable. I think it's rather reliable as long as you have some other people's subjective experience to compare it against, right? I guess you could call that a paradox of comparison or something.]

She stopped rubbing the soft head of the bird and set it down to look at it more closely. Of course it would say that. It was almost like a joke when she played it out in her mind moments later. A sentient server tucked away within her home, interfacing with the material world through a thin veneer of an extinct animal. Attitude was but a subroutine, so who else would point out the shortcomings of subjectivity with such sharpness? She never thought much about philosophy herself and she wasn’t in contact with others that were more oriented to such thought patterns. Solipsism, post-death, mind-body duality, epistemology...they all seemed like writing prompts and creative tools than existential concerns. Why bother with them outside of fiction? Why not just live?

Aranea hasn’t written in a very long time.

Either way, she was stunned yet again and could only procure her own silence in response. Two sages, as it were, looking at each other over the silent chessboard of her electronic tablet. The screen gleamed a bit and thick globs of light caught under her chin like bits of taffy. So too did the beats pass sticky and slow in their wake.

She was the first to break the long silence. Not with a vibrant “Well, fuck you too!” or a deflective truth of “Look, I don’t argue with people about these things” but with a soft puff that escaped her nostrils, an upward snap of the corner of her mouth, and a recollection of duty. It seemed her thoughts were coming quicker to her now that she remembered what she was arguing with her smart assistant for.

“Bird, what time is it?” she asked in newfound consideration.

The bird looked up and began to move it’s beak this time. It was a welcome change from the previous cathedral of windchimes echoing all around her. In the same twinkling voice as the original reminder it replied, “It’s 2 minutes to four, Aranea.”

“Alright. Prime time for tea.”

It chirped again. “The boiler is already active. The hottest setting on your faucet will do.”

“Oh. Thanks.”

Her chair squeaked on the floor as she rose out of her seat. Both the chair legs and the floor were resistant enough to scratches, but she still capped off the legs with a bit of rubber when she bought the house. It was a very old habit in her family but one that stuck around, as if it were an indestructible heirloom climbing down the years. However, such thoughts were blasted out of her mind as her feet registered the shock cold of the tile all beneath. Bitter swirls rose up her heels and crawled with such vigor to the arches that she almost stomped back on the firm floor. Still, she shook off the chill and trudged on to her higher cabinets. There was a bit of clanging when she reached up into the shelves but once her fingers caught the octagonal prism of today’s prey, it was swiped out in predatory silence. She didn’t have a large variety of tea, though. It was mostly variants of green tea, with a bright and vegetal bite, and black tea, with dense and astringent smokiness along with the occasional outlier.

Aranea personally found the task to be a delightful break and an unofficial calling card of her day. When the daily routine was so mild day in and day out, a bit of variety was very welcome. However, her mind seemed to be forgetting about the habit in recent weeks and so she had to stick with the daily pings from her software agent to keep things flavorful (literally).

Unluckily, she wasn’t very observant today. There was a vague awareness that the leaves looked a bit different this time, but it was only three minutes into the brewing process that she realized that she snatched the genmaicha--a blend of green tea and toasted rice. The bird chittered at her atop her shoulder, knowing that she took the wrong tin. Aranea could only look at her brewing vessel with mild betrayal. Her lips parted as if she were going to say something, but when she looked at her dutiful pot on the stove steeping away the tea, she remained silent.

The issue wasn't with the tea itself but her. When she first tried this blend, she immediately swore not to drink this one and save it for her few visitors since it was so delicious that she'd burn through the entire tin in a week. The worst part was that she knew she wasn't going to regret chugging down liters of genmaicha then, and certainly not now. It was simply that delectable. And for Aranea, whose sensory inputs lit up her local reality in shades of gustatory and olfactory pleasure, aural enamantions falling into her cochleas, visual cacophany down her rods and cones, and somatosensory embraces in a trail of lit neurons, she could agree. The toasty smell arose from her stove and wafted into her nostrils with careful pace. It was a lighter smell than her black teas, but still caramelized and rich in a way befitting the quick tart bite of the rest of the green tea base. 

The smell only intensified when the golden green liquid sloshed about within the upper chamber of her Chemex and filter. On the bottom of this glass hourglass, pale gold liquid sloshed about like waves on a ship window. But she was a captain with a proclivity for immediate direction, and so, she took care to swirl the contents around and around to prevent even more splashing. The light of the west window come through the Chemex, and as she continued to agitate the flow of the tea, it seemed to enfold itself into the bottom chamber. It glowed like liquid firelies. Aranea had never seen it before, but it was a pleasant sight regardless. Eventually she was able to pour the contents of her decanter into three smaller cups. Even with the light, the drink was startlingly clear.

The harder part was actually drinking it. Should she drink it all at once to purge the shame in a brief wellspring of floral catharsis, or should she savor the guilty pleasures of such a magnificent drink? Aranea looked over the set of filled cups. Two of the reflections seemed to be mouthing something to her, but their words could not escape the surface tension. The ensuing ripples were beautiful in their chaos, up and down *ad infinitum*. Meanwhile, the last reflection stared back at her with a curious, but silent, expression on her face.

Aranea hooked a finger around the miniature handle of the third cup and up it went on the ascent. It drifted in the happy medium of velocity, a careful synchronization with the passing of seconds until it halted at her mouth and tipped in a deep bow. Though her enamel took a sizable portion of the warmth, it still scattered along the inside of her cheeks and over her tongue. It was bold and roasty as expected, as if she were catching the tail end of her parent's coffee, yet there was something off about the flavor. It was almost as if someone stirred a bit of color into the drink. The clearest was blue, with such dense melancholia that it seemed to line her tongue and esophagus with pure cobalt. But soon there were bits of striking gold too, whose notorious rich hue brightened her nerves and spine. She drained the cup. 

The sun still hung in the sky, an hour away from plummeting into darkness. A faint sparkle from the teacup caught the corner of the eye, so she glanced down at the innocuous vessel in her hand. What was once a drained pool of liquid was now a full pool of light. It too came from the west window, and in time, the faint vitality set everything around it aflame with clarity. Her small, smooth hands. The stark unadorned texture of the wide teacup. The silicone bird shifting atop her right shoulder in automatic rebalance. Was there something outside?

Aranea drifted closer to the window. Outside, everything looked fine. Her concrete driveway shot out into the dark basalt road, but that didn't seem to be it. If the teacups were collecting light, they couldn't be collecting it from the earth, since the original target of light is the earth. The strangeness must lurk in the aether.

So she pulled her eyes up and up, and soon, the sky opened it’s cerulean arms to her yet again.
