## [dnd: in which the authors might not be completely dead (a guide)]()
----
*dnd: in which the authors might not be completely dead (a guide)* is a study guide tangential to the davetura source material. It is primarily authored by Day with suggestions by Dave.

Though dnd is rife with parodies and formatting breaks, the guide does *not* parody Sparknotes but instead takes on it's mantle as a comprehensive and neat study guide.

Unfortunately, development of the study guide stopped at Section 12 of Act 1. There is no guarantee it'll be maintained in the future, but this entry will be updated accordingly if it does.
