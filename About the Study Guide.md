## [dnd: in which the authors might not be completely dead (a guide)]()
---
*dnd: in which the authors might not be completely dead (a guide)* is a study guide tangential to the davetura source material. It is primarily authored by Day with suggestions by Dave.

The title is a clear nod to the "Death of the Author" concept wherein the author's intentions have no weight or relevancy when interpreting the writing. But by saying the authors are still somewhat alive, it implies that they still have something to say about the work. 

The document is much closer to real life than the actual universe of *dnd*, and can be seen as a kind of "Sparknotes" without the parodying,^[`in my opinion it should though`]^[[It was tempting when I first skipped up the doc, but honestly, I don't know how in-depth I can go into the narrative+character+theme analysis before it gets into Dirk Strider levels of creepy.]] by which it takes on the website's mantle as a comprehensive and neat study guide. Therefore, it is highly supplemental and can be read independently of *dnd* canon.

Unfortunately, development of the study guide stopped at Section 12 of Act 1^[Suspiciously when Day's prose starts to come apart at the seams.]. There is no guarantee it will be updated or maintained for the future, but this entry will be updated accordingly if it does. In the meantime, analysis of *dnd* can be found within this very wiki.
