# dnd

**dnd**, also known as **davetura**, is a real person fanfiction written by [[day|daytura]] and [[dave|davestridsr]] discussing themselves and each other. As a whole, it is a series of one-shots with sections within these works, each written in varying lengths. These sections alternate between the two different writers. It is mainly plotless, thick with metatext^[There are approximately 3 diegetic levels at any given moment within dnd: the main bulk of the story, the reflection on it, and the author/editor notes. In the wise words of Dave, it is dummy thick.], messy, and has a number of esoteric elements that alter the experience of reading it.
