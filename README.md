# davetura: [[dave]] and [[day]]

Welcome to Act 3 of the double self-authored RPF, dnd! It should be noted, however, that the newly-nebulous state of dnd may make it more applicable to simply call the entire project "davetura".

I'm currently working in my own davetura-day directory, which is based on the aptly-called "day" branch. Now that I think of it I probably should've called the entire thing davetura-day. Agh. Hopefully Git and Github can keep up with my mercurial-ass changes.
