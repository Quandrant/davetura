## Nyx

Also called Night^[It should be noted that the name "Night" is rarely used to refer to him, as it is implied that narrative focus onto him alters the very nature of his existence. See discussions of the [[Mindroom]], [[Narrative Focus]], and other character analyses for further information.], Nyx is an abstruse figure operating both in real life and the davetura narrative. Like Dave, he maintains true consistency between the real and fictional world.

In real life, he is a mental assistant of Day and lives up to his Greek namesake as a personification of darkness and obscurity. However, when he is not busy enveiling sensitive topics in Day's mind, he is sassy, spotaneous, and honest--especially in matters involving physical reality.

In the davetura narrative, Nyx is all of the above *and* a plot device. He is a common thread in all scenes involving the mindroom, and tempers Day's mercurial focus until the section is complete^[It could be something as simple as peppering Day with questions, or something more encompassing as physically interacting with Day's mental projection.]. However, his influence still has its shortcomings and he as a character can be falliable.
