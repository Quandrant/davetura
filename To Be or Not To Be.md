Day: *This poem was an AP Literature assignment. It is a rewrite of Hamlet's "To Be or Not To Be" where the titular character debates mortality and death. In my rewrite, I discuss the cyclical nature of the days, where each one is lived individually.*

> To be, or not to be, that is the question:
For occupation of thick reality
Lights candles within my dimly spun mind. 
Photons leap up like crickets and ensnare
Drizzles of colorful paintings of matter,
To be trapped by twin hickory circles,
And shuffled into my engine of qualia.
Muse, Muse, grant me inspiration, come out
Calliope! I must make an epic
of my life, to unbind this cyclic spell:
One where each morning gifts me existence.
And one where each night bequeath my death.
Too many moments between extremes lends me
A life oh trapped under the glass hull of
Each cursed, routine day. Schedules lose meaning:
I am born, I am motion, I am gone.
What is there to plan when I live three hundred
And sixty five lives, in only one year?
Maybe Mnemosyne will lend her steel gaze,
To divulge such clarity that I may
Journey a downtrodden path to her stream,
That which she can wash a fugue of dementia,
Dissolving the borders between days as if
I were to unlink myself, the raindrop,
And become one with the water around
me. Yet you know I am not here to speak
of transcendence but the impediment.
So by any god that dare touch my swift
Complacency, let me live, let me breathe,
Let me traverse this house of life than a 
Solemn labyrinth of chambers and halls.
